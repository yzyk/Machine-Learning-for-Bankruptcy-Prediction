# Problem description

You are to predict whether a company will go bankrupt in the following year, based on financial attributes of the company.

Perhaps you are contemplating lending money to a company, and need to know whether the company
is in near-term danger of not being able to repay.


## Goal

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate mastery on solving a classification problem and presenting
the entire Recipe for Machine Learning process in a notebook.
- We will make suggestions for ways to approach the problem
    - But there will be little explicit direction for this task.
- It is meant to be analogous to a pre-interview task that a potential employer might assign
to verify your skill

# Import modules


```python
## Standard imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import sklearn

import os
import math

%matplotlib inline

```

# API for students


```python
## Load the bankruptcy_helper module

from IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell
InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = "all"

# Reload all modules imported with %aimport
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 1

# Import bankruptcy_helper module
import bankruptcy_helper
%aimport bankruptcy_helper

helper = bankruptcy_helper.Helper()
```

# Get the data

The first step in our Recipe is Get the Data.

- Each example is a row of data corresponding to a single company
- There are 64 attributes, described in the section below
- The column `Bankrupt` is 1 if the company subsequently went bankrupt; 0 if it did not go bankrupt
- The column `Id` is a Company Identifier


```python
# Data directory
DATA_DIR = "./Data"

if not os.path.isdir(DATA_DIR):
    DATA_DIR = "../resource/asnlib/publicdata/bankruptcy/data"

data_file = "5th_yr.csv"
data = pd.read_csv( os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "train", data_file) )

target_attr = "Bankrupt"

n_samples, n_attrs = data.shape
print("Date shape: ", data.shape)
```

    Date shape:  (4818, 66)
    

## Have a look at the data

We will not go through all steps in the Recipe, nor in depth.

But here's a peek


```python
data.head()
```

This may still be somewhat unhelpful for those of you not used to reading Financial Statements.

But that's partially the point of the exercise
- You can *still* perform Machine Learning *even if* you are not an expert in the problem domain
    - That's what makes this a good interview exercise: you can demonstrate your thought process even if you don't know the exact meaning of the terms
- Of course: becoming an expert in the domain *will improve* your ability to create better models
    - Feature engineering is easier if you understand the features, their inter-relationships, and the relationship to the target

Let's get a feel for the data
- What is the type of each attribute ?

You may be puzzled:
- Most attributes are `object` and *not* numeric (`float64`)
- But looking at the data via `data.head()` certainly gives the impression that all attributes are numeric

Welcome to the world of messy data !  The dataset has represented numbers as strings.
- These little unexpected challenges are common in the real-word
- Data is rarely perfect and clean

So you might want to first convert all attributes to numeric

**Hint**
- Look up the Pandas method `to_numeric`
    - We suggest you use the option `errors='coerce'`
    

# Evaluating your project

We will evaluate your submission on a test dataset that we provide
- It has no labels, so **you** can't use it to evaluate your model, but **we** have the labels
- We will call this evaluation dataset the "holdout" data

Let's get it


```python
holdout_data = pd.read_csv( os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "holdout", '5th_yr.csv') )

print("Data shape: ", holdout_data.shape)

```

    Data shape:  (1092, 65)
    

We will evaluate your model on the holdout examples using metrics
- Accuracy
- Recall
- Precision

From our lecture: we may have to make a trade-off between Recall and Precision.

Our evaluation of your submission will be partially based on how you made (and described) the trade-off.

You may assume that it is 5 times worse to *fail to identify a company that will go bankrupt*
than it is to fail to identify a company that won't go bankrupt.

# Your model

Time for you to continue the Recipe for Machine Learning on your own.



## Submission guidelines

Although your notebook may contain many models (e.g., due to your iterative development)
we will only evaluate a single model.
So choose one (explain why !) and do the following.

- You will implement the body of a subroutine `MyModel`
    - That takes as argument a Pandas DataFrame 
        - Each row is an example on which to predict
        - The features of the example are elements of the row
    - Performs predictions on each example
    - Returns an array or predictions with a one-to-one correspondence with the examples in the test set
    

We will evaluate your model against the holdout data
- By reading the holdout examples `X_hold` (as above)
- Calling `y_hold_pred = MyModel(X_hold)` to get the predictions
- Comparing the predicted values `y_hold_pred` against the true labels `y_hold` which are known only to the instructors

See the following cell as an illustration
X_hold = pd.read_csv( os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "holdout", '5th_yr.csv') )

# Predict using MyModel
y_hold_pred = MyModel(X_hold)

# Compute metrics
# accuracy
accuracy_hold = accuracy_score(y_hold, y_hold_pred)

# recall_
recall_hold = recall_score(y_hold, y_hold_pred, pos_label=1, average="binary")

# precision
precision_hold = precision_score(y_hold,   y_hold_pred, pos_label=1, average="binary")


print("\t{m:s} Accuracy: {a:3.1%}, Recall {r:3.1%}, Precision {p:3.1%}".format(m=name,
                                                                            a=accuracy_hold,
                                                                            r=recall_hold,
                                                                            p=precision_hold
                                                                            )
         )
**Remember**

The holdout data is in the same format as the one we used for training
- Except that it has no attribute for the target
- So you will need to perform all the transformations on the holdout data
    - As you did on the training data
    - Including turning the string representation of numbers into actual numeric data types

All of this work *must* be performed within the body of the `MyModel` routine you will write

We will grade you by comparing the predictions array you create to the answers known to us.


```python

import pandas as pd
import os

def MyModel(X):
    # It should create an array of predictions; we initialize it to the empty array for convenience
    predictions = []
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    
    
    return predictions


```

# Check your work: predict and evaluate metrics on *your* test examples

Although only the instructors have the correct labels for the holdout dataset, you may want
to create your own test dataset on which to evaluate your out of sample metrics.

If you choose to do so, you can evaluate your models using the same metrics that the instructors will use.

- Test whether your implementation of `MyModel` works
- See the metrics  your model produces
name = "Choose a descriptive name for your model"
y_test_pred = MyModel(X_test)

accuracy_test = accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred)
recall_test = recall_score(y_test, y_test_pred, pos_label=1, average="binary")
precision_test = precision_score(y_test,   y_test_pred, pos_label=1, average="binary")

print("\t{m:s} Accuracy: {a:3.1%}, Recall {r:3.1%}, Precision {p:3.1%}".format(m=name,
                                                                            a=accuracy_test,
                                                                            r=recall_test,
                                                                            p=precision_test
